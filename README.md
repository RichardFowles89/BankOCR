Hello,
      To run this application, please download the code from Github. Included in the download is a file called BankData.txt which is just a file of sample data. 

To run the app, first build it in Visual Studio. Then navigate to the exe in the command line. From there, run the exe, passing the path to the BankData.txt (or your own data file) as an argument:

> cd <path to exe>
> BankOCR.exe <path to data>


Alternatively, if you would like to run the app from Visual Studio, change the 'file' variable to the path of the data file.
